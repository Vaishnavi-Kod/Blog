        <p>Holi, Hindu spring festival celebrated in India and Nepal on the full-moon day of Phalguna (February–March). Participants throw colored water and colored powders on one another, and license is given to deviate from the usual societal norms and rankings of caste, gender, status, and age. In the streets the celebrations of revelers who “play” Holi (Hindi: Holi khelna) are often marked by loud music and shouts of “Holi hai” (Hindi: “It’s Holi!”), as well as ribald language and behavior, as layers of multiple colors transcend any overt or societal differences. But at its conclusion, when everyone bathes, dons clean clothes, and visits friends, teachers, and relatives, the ordered patterns of society are reasserted and renewed. Holi has, over the years, gained popularity outside India and is celebrated among South Asian communities living in the United States, the United Kingdom, Caribbean countries, and other countries with Indian populations. Although Holi is a time to forget differences and celebrate with friends, family, and the larger community, the breaking of boundaries can result in incidents of harassment and brawls, prompting police departments to take precautionary security measures in many places across India.

            Holi colors can be used in powder form (in Hindi: gulal) or as colored water that is poured out of buckets and squirted from water guns (pichkaris). Traditionally, these colors were derived from plant sources: green from neem and henna leaves; yellow from turmeric and marigold; blue from indigo; and red from pomegranates, flame of the forest (Butea monosperma), and red sandalwood. In modern times, synthetically produced colored powders are used more often. These are cheap, are easily available, and come in bright hues. In some cases, commercially available synthetic colors may contain toxic, metal-based pigments or potentially hazardous dyes and can cause skin and eye irritation and burning. For those reasons, many people prefer to use herbal colors.
            Community gatherings, music, and food are important aspects of Holi celebrations. Sweets such as gujiya, a deep-fried dumpling or pastry filled with coconut and dried fruits; jalebi, a spiral-shaped dessert that is deep-fried and soaked in sugar syrup; and malpua, or Indian pancakes, are popular. Puran poli, a sweet flatbread made of wheat flour, chickpeas, and jaggery, is served in Maharashtra state, India. Street foods such as chaat and kachori (a savory snack with a crispy outer shell made of fried dough and a filling of cooked lentils and spices) and drinks such as lassi, thandai (a sweet, cold milk drink topped with almonds, saffron, poppy seeds, cardamom, and rose petals), and bhang (a mild cannabis-based drink) are often served among Holi revelers.
